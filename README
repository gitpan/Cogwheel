       Cogwheel is a framework for building Network Clients and Servers. It is
       based off the Sprocket library and Moose.

MMEETTHHOODDSS
       None of the methods in Cogheel itself are truely public, but they are
       documented here for completeness.

       import
           Called via "use Cogwheel;" this will setup the metaclass system
           properly so that Coghweel objects inherit from "Cogwheel::Object".
           This also enables "strict" and "warnings".

       unimport
           Unimports any methods exported by import;

       meta
           Imported from Moose.
